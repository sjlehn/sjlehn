## Hi there

I'm currently helping Casechek innovate the medical implant supply chain.

When I'm not doing that, I'm taking care of the family, fixing up the house, and raising sheep and an English Shepherd (who's supposed to be a herding dog but isn't so sure about that yet).

I'm a big fan of JetBrains products, Idea and PhpStorm in particular. I write Typescript and Javascript and PHP, and used to write Java. If I had free time I'd learn C, mostly just to know it.

I run [Debian](https://debian.org) where I can (at home) and MacOS where I can't (at work).

I once tried to make `emacs` work like an IDE, but the barrier to entry there is steep, and Jetbrains is cool. `nano` gets the job done when it comes to text editing.

🐚 I love working in the command line, and will take `grep` over CloudWatch any day. (The fact that there isn't a terminal/shell emote is disappointing). Check out ohmyzsh and powerlevel9k, if you haven't already.

If you haven't been outside today, get up and do it. Get your hands in the dirt. Eat real food, talk to real people.

PS - There's also my [favorite essay](https://stilldrinking.org/programming-sucks) concerning my present line of work, that is well worth a read 😃

PPS - Apple: Cmd+Tab should swich _windows_ not applications. Cmd+` doesn't count.
